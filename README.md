# OpenCV Image Processing  
This repository contains a simple Python project using OpenCV and NumPy for image processing.

## Files  
- `script.py` — Python script that loads an image, applies grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection.  
- `Output.jpg` — Resulting image saved after processing.  
- `README.md` — Explanation and setup instructions.

## Setup & Run  
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with OpenCV and NumPy:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
# opencv-image-processing
Minimal OpenCV assignment with script, output, and explanation.
